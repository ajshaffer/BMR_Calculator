# BMR_Calculator
A very basic basal metabolic rate (BMR) calculator written in python. 
Your BMR is the amount of calories your body burns if you were to lay in bed all day and do nothing. In order to gain or lose weight,
you must consume calories above or below your BMR, respectively. Of course, day to day activities and exercise increases the amount of calories you burn
each day.
